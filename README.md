This exercise is an introduction into Viromics. We’ll be looking at two metagenomic samples that have already been through a basic bioinformatics pipeline. The input files are assembled contigs from the tool megahit, they’ve been aligned to the human genome to remove any human contamination. These two samples are from the same patient experiencing UTI infections: (1) SRR14881730 a stool sample, and (2) SRR14881811 a urine sample. Urine was thought to be sterile, but research has found that there are distinct microbial communities, we’ll be looking into both samples to see if any virions or mobile genetic elements are shared between both microbial environments.
